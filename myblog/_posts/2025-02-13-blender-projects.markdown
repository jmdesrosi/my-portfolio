Welcome to my Blender page!
Here is where I will be showcasing some of my projects, either for my games, or just to learn and have fun!

For starters, I recently decided to create some low-poly scenes. Here is a smaller one, a small island with a lonely hermit house sitting atop.

And here is a larger one, procedurally generated using Blender's geometry nodes! I followed a tutorial to get some ideas and learn how the nodes work, but I threw my own low-poly twist onto it!

I will update this post as I create new models!
